# RateMyDoctor
For my group project for this course, we had to design and make a database name RateMyDoctor to solve a fictional business problem for an organization of our choosing. We decide to help a medical center call Fairfax Clinic and solve their fictional problem of why some patients were not returning to the clinic. We, therefore, created a database that will provide important feedback taken from anonymous patients about their experience and issues with the clinic. The feedback would then be given to the clinic staff to improve customer services. Our final project report contains an As-Is Business Process Map, To-Be Business Process Map, Entity Relationship Diagram, Logical Database Design, the DDL SQL to create the database, the DML SQL to insert the data into the database, and SQL queries to use.
